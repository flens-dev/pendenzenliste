# Introduction and Goals

Pendenzenliste is a highly over-engineered application that can be used to manage todos.
The main goal of the project is to exercise designing a non-trivial application in a CLEAN-Architecture.

The users of the application define for themselves how they want to run the application.
This may mean that the app is run in a web application, a CLI or an android app.
If the user desires it the user should be able to synchronize the data between multiple of his personal devices.

# Cross-cutting Concepts

## Controller

A `Controller` creates a `Request` and invokes the appropriate `InputBoundary` with it.

The `Controller` is not accessed directly, but rather listens to events from the application and acts as it seems fit to
those events.

## Entity

An `Entity` is some kind of persistent object that belongs to the domain.

It may contain other `ValueObject`s.

Each `Entity` is accessed through an appropriate `Gateway`.

## Event

An `Event` describes some kind of meaningful state change within the application or domain that happened in the past.

## Gateway

A gateway provides access to some kind of external system such as a database or a REST API.

## InputBoundary

An `InputBoundary` defines a public interface for objects that handle the `UseCase` specific inputs of the application.
It receives a `Request` and an `OutputBoundary` and produces a `Response`.
The `Response` will then be used to update the `OutputBoundary`.

## OutputBoundary

An `OutputBoundary` defines a public interface for objects that handle the responses of the applications `UseCase`s.

## Presenter

A `Presenter` is an application specific implementation of an `OutputBoundary`.
The `Presenter` modifies the `ViewModel`, which is bound to a `View`, so the `Presenter` indirectly modifies the data
displayed by the `View`.

## UseCase

A `UseCase` implements an `InputBoundary` and encapsulates the interactions required to fulfill some kind of goal within
the application.

## Request

A `Request` encapsulates the data used to invoke an `InputBoundary` in a technology-agnostic format.
The `Request` may only contain native datatypes, such as strings, integers, etc., or `RequestModel`s.

## RequestModel

A `RequestModel` encapsulates complex data structures that may be a member of a `Request`, but cannot be represented in
a primitive datatype.

An example for this would be a list of key value pairs that need to be passed to the `InputBoundary`.

## Response

A `Response` encapsulates the data used to invoke an `OutputBoundary` in a technology-agnostic format.

The `Response` may only contain native datatypes, such as strings, integers, etc., or `ResponseModel`s.

## ResponseModel

A `ResponseModel` is a technology-agnostic model that may be contained in a `Response`.

The `ResponseModel` may represent some kind of `Entity` without exposing the actual data types of the domain module.

## ValueObject

A `ValueObject` represents some kind of domain-specific data type.

## View

A `View` provides a user the means to look at and enter new data into the application.

It binds to a `ViewModel`, which stores all the data used to display the data for the end user.

## ViewModel

A `ViewModel` is an application-specific model of the data displayed by a `View`.
The `ViewModel` provides means for a `View` to bind to its properties.
Both the `Presenter` and `View` may update the properties to store the displayed data.
