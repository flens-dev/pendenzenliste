# Introduction and Goals

Pendenzenliste is a highly over-engineered application that can be used to manage todos.
The main goal of the project is to exercise designing a non-trivial application in a CLEAN-Architecture.

The users of the application define for themselves how they want to run the application.
This may mean that the app can be run in e.g. a web, CLI or android app.
If the user desires it the user should be able to synchronize the data between multiple of his personal devices.

| gateway implementation | Is accessed by the application to store and retrieve the users todo data |

## Technical Context

![Technical context](diagrams/technical-context.drawio.png)

The system is used by interactive users through different kinds of apps.
These may e.g. be desktop, mobile or cli apps.
Each app is implemented in its own separate module.

Applications may use the input boundaries provided by the boundary module to invoke the desired use cases.

The use cases will respond to the executed requests by calling the output boundaries with the appropriate responses to
the request. These responses can be used to update the views of the calling app.

The applications may be configured to use a variety of different gateway implementations.
These include filesystem, inmemory or redis storages for the data managed by the pendenzenliste.

_As the system is intended to be highly configurable we cannot make any assumptions on the supported or unsupported
protocols of the technical context._

# Cross-cutting Concepts

## Controller

A `Controller` creates a `Request` and invokes the appropriate `InputBoundary` with it.

The `Controller` is not accessed directly, but rather listens to events from the application and acts as it seems fit to
those events.

## Entity

An `Entity` is some kind of persistent object that belongs to the domain.

It may contain other `ValueObject`s.

Each `Entity` is accessed through an appropriate `Gateway`.

## Event

An `Event` describes some kind of meaningful state change within the application or domain that happened in the past.

## Gateway

A gateway provides access to some kind of external system such as a database or a REST API.

## InputBoundary

An `InputBoundary` defines a public interface for objects that handle the `UseCase` specific inputs of the application.
It receives a `Request` and an `OutputBoundary` and produces a `Response`.
The `Response` will then be used to update the `OutputBoundary`.

## OutputBoundary

An `OutputBoundary` defines a public interface for objects that handle the responses of the applications `UseCase`s.

## Page

A `Page` is an application specific wrapper for a view that is used to register handlers and do some general wiring for
the view.
This pattern can be used in the context of a framework that has no other means to register those resources, but should
only allow sane dependencies.

## Presenter

A `Presenter` is an application specific implementation of an `OutputBoundary`.
The `Presenter` modifies the `ViewModel`, which is bound to a `View`, so the `Presenter` indirectly modifies the data
displayed by the `View`.

## Request

A `Request` encapsulates the data used to invoke an `InputBoundary` in a technology-agnostic format.
The `Request` may only contain native datatypes, such as strings, integers, etc., or `RequestModel`s.

## RequestModel

A `RequestModel` encapsulates complex data structures that may be a member of a `Request`, but cannot be represented in
a primitive datatype.

An example for this would be a list of key value pairs that need to be passed to the `InputBoundary`.

## Response

A `Response` encapsulates the data used to invoke an `OutputBoundary` in a technology-agnostic format.

The `Response` may only contain native datatypes, such as strings, integers, etc., or `ResponseModel`s.

## ResponseModel

A `ResponseModel` is a technology-agnostic model that may be contained in a `Response`.

The `ResponseModel` may represent some kind of `Entity` without exposing the actual data types of the domain module.

## UseCase

A `UseCase` implements an `InputBoundary` and encapsulates the interactions required to fulfill some kind of goal within
the application.

## ValueObject

A `ValueObject` represents some kind of domain-specific data type.

## View

A `View` provides a user the means to look at and enter new data into the application.

It binds to a `ViewModel`, which stores all the data used to display the data for the end user.

## ViewModel

A `ViewModel` is an application-specific model of the data displayed by a `View`.
The `ViewModel` provides means for a `View` to bind to its properties.
Both the `Presenter` and `View` may update the properties to store the displayed data.
